# PROJECT GOALS BASED ON DATE:

MONDAY 6 - 5 - 2023
    Project was started.
    Basic outline and project goals

TUESDAY 6 - 6 - 2023
    Started pseudoCoding
    Research for project
    I also went fishing, but that's probably not relevant...

WEDNESDAY 6 - 7 - 2023
    Continuing pseudoCoding before class
    Skeleton code in readMe is finished
    Will run NPM Install and implement skeleton frame today in class
    Will try to have PseudoCode done

Thursday 6 - 7 - 2023
    Goal is to have a working and running skeleton framework
    With pseudocoding done, implementation should become reletively easy
    I have work this day, and till Monday, so if these goals are met we'll both be ahead of the game to tweak any issues later on.
